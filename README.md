<summary><h3>👨‍💻 SrEgg Coding Journey</h3></summary>
Ever since I was young, I loved playing old Counter‑Strike on my old laptop. I would even go to computer shops just to play games. That’s where my fascination with computers began. Back then, I became interested in “hacking” because it sounded cool, but I never actually learned how to hack—and I didn’t even know programming languages existed. Later on, I entered senior high school and chose the IT major because I wanted to understand computers more deeply. That was where I really discovered what programming languages were—but honestly, I didn’t take it seriously yet. When the pandemic started, I grew curious about how software was created. That curiosity pushed me to try coding for the first time. I began with the basics: HTML and CSS. It felt exciting to build something on my own, even if it was simple. My real turning point came when I went to college. My dream was to take Computer Science at a different school, but due to some unexpected events, I ended up choosing Computer Engineering instead. At first it felt like bad luck, but it actually became one of the best decisions I made. Through my coursework, I finally learned how to program properly and found myself improving step by step. And now, here I am—still learning, still coding, and still growing my passion for technology.
